# PRACTICE-KEYLOGGER

Virus created in Python, in a secure environment, which consists of recording all keyboard entries made by the person running the program in a .txt file. All keys and possible entries that I think will be recorded in order and with consistency.

## Description
This program was created to identify the types of vulnerabilities to which a computer is exposed. This keylogger virus creates a .txt file in which everything typed by the person running this program is saved. If you want to exit the program, press the “esc” key.
And if you want to see all the entries you have made on the keyboard, just run the infor.txt file and you will see all the keys you have typed.

## Instalation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/EAvla13/PRACTICE-KEYLOGGER.git
2. Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   In WINDOWS:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   In Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
3. Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the program
   python main.py
## Use
Once you run the main.py file, all the keys you type on your keyboard will be saved in a .txt file in the same location where you ran main.py. All keyboard entries will be found there.
If you want to exit the program to check all the text entries made by the user, press the “esc” key and the program will exit.
